👋 Hi, I’m @DSL-21 — self-taught QA learner, Python + Selenium explorer, and ex-military.
🧠 I’m currently studying test automation, basic cybersecurity, and algorithmic trading with MQL5.
💻 I enjoy building small but real test scripts, breaking virtual labs, and learning how systems fail — to make them stronger.
🤝 Looking to collaborate on QA/testing, automation, or ethical hacking projects that help sharpen skills and build experience.
